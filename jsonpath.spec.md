# JSONPath queries

jsonpath is a standard for transforming JSON documents that is geared for inclusion in an upcoming release of Postgres.

It's a reasonably complex standard so it's unclear how much of it is feasible for inclusion in 1.2.
Tentatively I would lean against inclusion and scope it for 1.3.
There's a good explanation of the value and power of it at [this post](http://gmile.me/jsonpath/).
